    # Welcome to UI component library ðŸŽ‰

    Because Storybook works separately from your app, you'll need to configure it for your specific stack and setup

    ## ðŸ“š How to start?
    
    Few easy steps. Let's start!

    ### Select the Node.js version 18+

    ```
    nvm use 18
    ```

    ### Install dependencies

    ```
    npm i
    ```

    ### Run the storybook

    ```
    npm run sb
    ```

    ## ðŸ“š How to run the tests?

    Prepare your environment

    ### Install Playwright to run UI tests
    ```
    npx playwright install
    ```

    ### Run UI tests
    ```
    npm run sb         # in the first terminal tab
    ```
    ```
    npm run test:ui    # in the second terminal tab
    ```

    or

    ### Run Unit tests
    ```
    npm run test:unit
    ```

    ## ðŸ“š How to use UI component library in your project

    Build and link the library

    ### Build the UI component library
    ```
    npm run build:lib
    ```

    ### Create symlink with UI component library via npm
    ```
    npm link
    ```

    ### Open your own project and 'link-install' the UI component library
    ```
    npm link @pathliving/components
    ```

    ### Import and use the Button from UI component library

    > <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>*Pay attention! Do not attempt to use it in 'server components'. The Button component can only be used in 'client components' because it has event handlers</p>

    ```
    import { Button } from '@pathliving/components';

    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <>
          Home page
          <Button onClick={() => alert('Hi!')}>Click me!</Button>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```
  </div>
</div>
